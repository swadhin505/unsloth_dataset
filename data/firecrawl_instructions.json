      "answer": "To determine if your model is underfitting or overfitting, you should monitor both training and validation loss during the training process:\n- **Underfitting**: If both training and validation loss are high, your model is likely too simplistic and not capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\n- **Overfitting**: If the training loss decreases while the validation loss increases, your model is learning the training data too well and failing to generalize.\nVisualizing these losses can help you identify the issue and adjust your training strategy accordingly."

    {
      "instruction": "What are the key hyperparameters to adjust when fine-tuning a model, and how do they affect training?",
      "answer": "When fine-tuning a model, key hyperparameters include `per_device_train_batch_size`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, `max_steps`, and `learning_rate`. Here's a brief overview of their effects:\n- `per_device_train_batch_size`: This controls the number of samples processed at once. Increasing it can improve GPU utilization but may slow down training due to padding. Instead, consider increasing `gradient_accumulation_steps` for smoother training.\n- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: This simulates a larger batch size without increasing memory usage. For example, setting it to 4 allows you to accumulate gradients over 4 steps before updating the model.\n- `max_steps`: This parameter speeds up training by limiting the number of steps. For full runs, replace it with `num_train_epochs` to train over multiple epochs (1-3 epochs are recommended to avoid overfitting).\n- `learning_rate`: This controls how much to adjust the model weights during training. A lower learning rate (e.g., `1e-4`, `5e-5`, or `2e-5`) allows for slower but more precise fine-tuning."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How can I monitor the training loss during the fine-tuning process?",
      "answer": "During training, you will see a log of training loss numbers. Your goal is to adjust hyperparameters to bring this loss as close to 0.5 as possible. If the loss is not reaching values like 1, 0.8, or 0.5, consider adjusting your dataset or hyperparameters. If the loss goes to 0, it may indicate overfitting."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "What is the recommended setting for `per_device_train_batch_size` and why?",
      "answer": "The recommended setting for `per_device_train_batch_size` is 2. This allows for better GPU utilization while avoiding excessive padding that can slow down training. If you want to increase the effective batch size, consider adjusting `gradient_accumulation_steps` instead, which allows you to accumulate gradients over multiple steps without increasing memory usage."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How can I speed up training while fine-tuning a model?",
      "answer": "To speed up training, you can set `max_steps` to a lower value, such as 60. However, for full training runs, it is recommended to replace this with `num_train_epochs` set to 1-3 epochs to ensure the model is trained adequately without overfitting."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "What should I consider when adjusting the learning rate during fine-tuning?",
      "answer": "When adjusting the learning rate, consider starting with a value like `2e-4`. If you find that the model is not converging well, try lowering it to values like `1e-4`, `5e-5`, or `2e-5`. A lower learning rate allows for more precise fine-tuning but may require longer training times. Always monitor the training loss to ensure that the adjustments are leading to better performance."
